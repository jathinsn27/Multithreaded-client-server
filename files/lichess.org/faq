It is pronounced <em>lee-chess</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRpPqcrdE-o">Hear it pronounced by a specialist.</a></p><p>Live, because games are played and watched in real-time 24/7; light and libre for the fact that Lichess is open-source and unencumbered by proprietary junk that plagues other websites.</p><p>Similarly, the source code for Lichess, <a href="https://github.com/lichess-org/lila">lila</a>, stands for li[chess in sca]la, seeing as the bulk of Lichess is written in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, an intuitive programming language.</p></div></div><div id="contributing" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#contributing">How can I contribute to Lichess?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Lichess is powered by donations from patrons and the efforts of a team of volunteers.</p><p>You can find out more about <a href="patron">being a patron</a> (including a <a href="https://lichess.org/costs">breakdown of our costs</a>). If you want to help Lichess by volunteering your time and skills, there are many <a href="https://lichess.org/help/contribute">other ways to help</a>.</p></div></div><div id="sites_based_on_Lichess" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#sites_based_on_Lichess">Are there websites based on Lichess?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Yes. Lichess has indeed inspired other open-source sites that use our <a href="source">Source Code</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/api">API</a>, or <a href="https://database.lichess.org">Database</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://blitztactics.com/about">Blitz Tactics</a></li><li><a href="https://tailuge.github.io/chess-o-tron/html/blunder-bomb.html">Blunder Bomb</a></li><li><a href="https://lidraughts.org">lidraughts.org</a></li><li><a href="https://playstrategy.org">playstrategy.org</a></li><li><a href="https://lishogi.org">lishogi.org</a></li></ul></div></div><div id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#keyboard-shortcuts">What keyboard shortcuts are there?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Some Lichess pages have keyboard shortcuts you can use. Try pressing the &#39;?&#39; key on a study, analysis, puzzle, or game page to list available keyboard shortcuts.</p></div></div><h2>Fair Play</h2><div id="rating-refund" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#rating-refund">When am I eligible for the automatic rating refund from cheaters?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>One minute after a player is marked, their 40 latest rated games in the last 5 days are taken. If you were their opponent in one of those games, you lost rating (because of a loss or a draw), and your rating was not provisional, you get a rating refund. The refund is capped based on your peak rating and your rating progress after the game. (For example, if your rating greatly increased after that game, you might get no refund or only a partial refund.) A refund will never exceed 150 points.</p></div></div><div id="leaving" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#leaving">What is done about players leaving games without resigning?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>If your opponent frequently aborts/leaves games, they get &quot;play banned&quot;, which means they&#39;re temporarily banned from playing games. This is not publicly indicated on their profile. If this behaviour continues, the length of the playban increases - and prolonged behaviour of this nature may lead to account closure.</p></div></div><div id="mod-application" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#mod-application">How can I become a moderator?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>It’s not possible to apply to become a moderator. If we see someone who we think would be good as a moderator, we will contact them directly.</p></div></div><div id="correspondence" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#correspondence">Is correspondence different from normal chess?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>On Lichess, the main difference in rules for correspondence chess is that an opening book is allowed. The use of engines is still prohibited and will result in being flagged for engine assistance. Although ICCF allows engine use in correspondence, Lichess does not.</p><p>For more information, please read our <a href="https://lichess.org/page/fair-play">fair play page</a></p></div></div><h2>Gameplay</h2><div id="time-controls" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#time-controls">How are Bullet, Blitz and other time controls decided?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Lichess time controls are based on estimated game duration = <strong>(clock initial time in seconds) + 40 × (clock increment)</strong>.<br>For instance, the estimated duration of a 5+3 game is 5 × 60 + 40 × 3 = 420 seconds.</p><ul><li>≤ 29s = UltraBullet</li><li>≤ 179s = Bullet</li><li>≤ 479s = Blitz</li><li>≤ 1499s = Rapid</li><li>≥ 1500s = Classical</li></ul></div></div><div id="variants" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#variants">What variants can I play on Lichess?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Lichess supports standard chess and <a href="https://lichess.org/variant">8 chess variants</a>.</p></div></div><div id="acpl" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#acpl">What is the average centipawn loss (ACPL)?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>The centipawn is the unit of measure used in chess as representation of the advantage. A centipawn is equal to 1/100th of a pawn. Therefore 100 centipawns = 1 pawn. These values play no formal role in the game but are useful to players, and essential in computer chess, for evaluating positions.<br><br>The top computer move will lose zero centipawns, but lesser moves will result in a deterioration of the position, measured in centipawns.<br><br>This value can be used as an indicator of the quality of play. The fewer centipawns one loses per move, the stronger the play.<br><br>The computer analysis on Lichess is powered by Stockfish.</p></div></div><div id="timeout" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#timeout">Losing on time, drawing and insufficient material</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>In the event of one player running out of time, that player will usually lose the game. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player&#39;s king by any possible series of legal moves (<a href="https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023">FIDE handbook §6.9</a>).<br><br>In rare cases this can be difficult to decide automatically (forced lines, fortresses). By default we always side with the player who did not run out of time.<br><br>Note that it can be possible to mate with a single knight or bishop if the opponent has a piece that could block the king.</p></div></div><div id="en-passant" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#en-passant">Why can a pawn capture another pawn when it is already passed? (en passant)</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>This is a legal move known as &quot;en passant&quot;. The Wikipedia article gives a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant">good introduction</a>.<br><br>It is described in sections 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.3.2 of the <a href="https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023">FIDE handbook</a>:<br><br>&quot;A pawn occupying a square on the same rank as and on an adjacent file to an opponent’s pawn which has just advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.&quot;<br><br>See the <a href="learn#/15">Lichess training</a> on this move for some practice with it.</p><p>Watch International Master Eric Rosen checkmate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/p9wuic/eric_rosen_ascending/">en passant</a>.</p></div></div><div id="threefold" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#threefold">Threefold repetition</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>If a position occurs three times, players can claim a draw by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition">threefold repetition</a>. Lichess implements the official FIDE rules, as described in Article 9.2 of the <a href="https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023">FIDE handbook</a>.</p><h4>We did not repeat moves. Why was the game still drawn by repetition?</h4><p>Threefold repetition is about repeated <em>positions</em>, not moves. Repetition does not have to occur consecutively.</p><h4>We repeated a position three times. Why was the game not drawn?</h4><p>Repetition needs to be claimed by one of the players. You can do so by pressing the button that is shown, or by offering a draw before your final repeating move, it won&#39;t matter if your opponent rejects the draw offer, the threefold repetition draw will be claimed anyway. You can also <a href="https://lichess.org/account/preferences/game-behavior">configure</a> Lichess to automatically claim repetitions for you. Additionally, fivefold repetition always immediately ends the game.</p></div></div><h2>Accounts</h2><div id="titles" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#titles">What titles are there on Lichess?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Lichess recognises all FIDE titles gained from OTB (over the board) play, as well as <a href="https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/wiki/Handling-title-verification-requests">many national master titles</a>.

One hour later, he smashed Stockfish, and the promise was honoured.</p></div></div><h2>Lichess ratings</h2><div id="ratings" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#ratings">What rating system does Lichess use?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Ratings are calculated using the Glicko-2 rating method developed by Mark Glickman. This is a very popular rating method, and is used by a significant number of chess organisations (FIDE being a notable counter-example, as they still use the dated Elo rating system).<br><br>Fundamentally, Glicko ratings use &quot;confidence intervals&quot; when calculating and representing your rating. When you first start using the site, your rating starts at 1500 ± 1000. The 1500 represents your rating, and the 1000 represents the confidence interval.<br><br>Basically, the system is 95% sure that your rating is somewhere between 500 and 2500. It is incredibly uncertain. Because of this, when a player is just starting out, their rating will change very dramatically, potentially several hundred points at a time. But after some games against established players the confidence interval will narrow, and the amount of points gained/lost after each game will decrease.<br><br>Another point to note is that, as time passes, the confidence interval will increase. This allows you to gain/lose points more rapidly to match any changes in your skill level over that time.</p><p><a href="https://lichess.org/page/rating-systems">More about rating systems</a></p></div></div><div id="provisional" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#provisional">Why is there a question mark (?) next to a rating?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>The question mark means the rating is provisional. Reasons include:</p><ul><li>The player has not yet finished enough rated games against <em>opponents of similar strength</em> in the rating category.</li><li>The player hasn&#39;t played enough recent games. Depending on the number of games you&#39;ve played, it might take around a year of inactivity for your rating to become provisional again.</li></ul><p>Concretely, it means that the Glicko-2 deviation is greater than 110. The deviation is the level of confidence the system has in the rating.

Different organisations have different levels of players, different rating systems (Elo, Glicko, Glicko-2, or a modified version of the aforementioned). These factors can drastically affect the absolute numbers (ratings).<br><br>It&#39;s best to think of ratings as &quot;relative&quot; figures (as opposed to &quot;absolute&quot; figures): Within a pool of players, their relative differences in ratings will help you estimate who will win/draw/lose, and how often. Saying &quot;I have X rating&quot; means nothing unless there are other players to compare that rating to.</p><p><a href="https://lichess.org/page/rating-systems">More about rating systems</a></p></div></div><div id="hide-ratings" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#hide-ratings">How to hide ratings while playing?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Enable Zen-mode in the <a href="https://lichess.org/account/preferences/game-display">display preferences</a>, or by pressing <em>z</em> during a game.</p></div></div><div id="disconnection-loss" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#disconnection-loss">I lost a game due to lag/disconnection.

The latter is very rare though. Also note that when Lichess restarts and you lose on time because of that, we abort the game to prevent an unfair loss.</p></div></div><h2>How to...</h2><div id="browser-notifications" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#browser-notifications">Enable or disable notification popups?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p><img src="https://lichess1.org/assets/_LwALQR/images/connection-info.png" alt="View site information popup" /></p><p>Lichess can optionally send popup notifications, for example when it is your turn or you received a private message.<br><br>Click the lock icon next to the lichess.org address in the URL bar of your browser.<br><br>Then select whether to allow or block notifications from Lichess.</p></div></div><div id="autoplay" class="question"><h3><a href="faq#autoplay">Enable autoplay for sounds?</a></h3><div class="answer"><p>Most browsers can prevent sound from playing on a freshly loaded page to protect users.
